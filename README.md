# PowerlineFrequency-50Hz
PowerShell script to change Integrated Webcam from 60Hz to 50Hz

My company purchases all computers from the United States and ships them across the world to our satellite locations. As most of our locations, but not all, have powerline frequency of 50Hz it causes flickering in video calls. Some apps give the option of switching between 50 and 60 hertz, not all apps do (such as Microsoft Teams). 

This script can be uploaded into Azure AD or ran via on-prem AD or wherever/however you wish. 

This has been confirmed functional on multiple models of Dell brand laptops running Windows 10 (1903) and higher.
